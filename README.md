# Katyusha_signal_page Performance System

**Катюша** is an integrated platform designed to display Excel files in a single page, so you don't need to open multiple files separately. It allows you to:

- Upload an Excel file to the designated area.
- Open and edit the file directly within the system.

## Important Notes

Some sheets must not have their names changed to ensure system integrity:
- **Mail Sheet**
- **Templates Sheet**
- **Data Sheet**
- **SystemSteps Sheet**

You can modify the content within these sheets, but **do not change their names**.

## Features

Once files are uploaded, the system provides the following tools:

- **Shipping Fee Calculator**: Easily calculate shipping costs.
- **Deal Request**: Request invoice deferral.
- **Mail Template**: Set up and use email templates.
- **Customer Data Registration**: Record customer data and send automatic reminders every five minutes for periodic follow-ups.

> **Note**: There's also a small, independent calculator inside the system for quick calculations, which is separate from the other tools.

## Links & Data

This feature provides direct links to different pages, either within the system or to external resources.
